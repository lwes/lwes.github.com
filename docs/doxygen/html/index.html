<h1>Light Weight Event System (LWES) </h1><h3 class="version">0.23.1 </h3><p>The LWES Light-Weight Event System is a framework for allowing the exchange of information from many machines to many machines in a controlled, platform neutral, language neutral way. The exchange of information is done in a connectless fashion using multicast or unicast UDP, and using self describing data so that any platform or language can translate it to it's local dialect.</p>
<p>This leads to a system with the following features</p>
<ul>
<li>Fire and Forget messaging</li>
<li>Decoupling of senders (emitters) from receivers (listeners, journallers)</li>
<li>Centerless, no single point of failure</li>
<li>Support for many to many communication where nodes can enter and leave the system at any time.</li>
<li>Computer language and Hardware Platform independent</li>
</ul>
<p>The system consists of two major components</p>
<p>Emitter - a source of events, this is usually a server or process which wants to announce something</p>
<p>Listener - a sink of events which deserializes and processes events on the fly as they are received.</p>
<p>There is also a custom listener which defers deserialization until some point in the future, and simply captures and writes the events to a log. This is in the pj package, and is called a journaller.</p>
<p>This library is the 'C' implementations of the LWES. There is also a perl xsubs wrapper, and a pure java implementation packaged separately. All should be wire format compatible.</p>
<p>For more information on developing with the LWES see <a href="http://www.lwes.org">http://www.lwes.org</a> </p>
